/*Given a matrix a[1..n][1..n], this routine replaces it by the LU decomposition of a rowwise
permutation of itself. a and n are input. a is output, arranged as in equation (2.3.14) above;
indx[1..n] is an output vector that records the row permutation eﬀected by the partial
pivoting; d is output as ±1 depending on whether the number of row interchanges was even
or odd, respectively. This routine is used in combination with lubksb to solve linear equations
or invert a matrix.*/
